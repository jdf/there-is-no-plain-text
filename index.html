<h1>There is No Such Thing as Plain Text</h1>
<h2>Avoiding 文字化け (Mojibake)</h2>
<h3>Jonathan Feinberg</h3>
<h4>IBM Research, CUE</h4>
<div class="handout">
	<p>Thank you</p>
	<p>I'm Jonathan Feinberg, and I'm a programmer upstairs here at the Center.</p>
	<p>
		My title means that it's not enough to say that 
		some file is a "text file"; you have to be explicit about its encoding and character set.
	</p>
		<p>
			Now, we're here to talk about text, but in our conversations we've
			leapt over the question of what text really is, from the computer's
			perspective. It turns out that representing text is not trivial, 
			which is why things are sometimes garbled in your emails. This garble
			is called Mojibake, or so Wikipedia tells me.
		</p>
		<p>I came to think about these when I made...

</p>
	<div class="handout">
		<p>...the Wordle web site. When people asked me to support their
		languages, I had to learn a lot about these things, very quickly.</p>
		<p>
			This talk is basically the punch line of a long and
			technical talk I like to give, called "Unicode for Smarties".
			My point is not just to evangelize Unicode, but also to deliver
			the message that an understanding of how text works in
			computers is both important for the work we do and accessible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, I can't possibly do that properly in 5 minutes.
			So, for now, I'll have to settle for simply telling you what to do.

<div class="slide">
<h1>Do These Things</h1>
<p class="incremental">Use Unicode as your character set.</p>
<p class="incremental">Use UTF-8 as the encoding for your text files.</p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Text in Computers</h1>
<p>In order to represent written language in computer memory,
you need two things:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="incremental">A coded character set</li>
	<li class="incremental">An encoding that turns code points into byte sequences and vice versa</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Character Sets Are Better Than Others</h1>
<p>Some character sets are better than others.</p>
<div class="handout">
What makes one character set better than another? It has more
characters in it! For example, the default character set on
this computer--windows-1252--doesn't know anything about
non-latin alphabets.
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Character Sets Are Better Than Others</h1>
<p>You should use Unicode.</p>
<div class="handout">
Unicode provides a universal coded character set.

"Universal" means that it contains all of the characters in all
of the world's written languages, including many dead scripts
and a good number of made-up ones.
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Encodings Are Better Than Others</h1>
<div class="handout">
	The reasons are entirely technical, and we don't have a lot
	of time, but I'll try to at least convince you that the
	reasons exist to prefer one encoding over another.
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Encodings Are Better Than Others</h1>
	<p>Real-world example: Windows CP-932 encoding</p>
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<img style="margin-bottom:24px" src="windows-932-1.png" alt="Characters with overlapping code units"/>
		<br/>
		<img src="windows-932-2.png" alt="illustration of inefficiencies in decoding same"/>
	</div>
<div class="handout">
	<p>This is the actual default encoding on Windows running in the 
	Japanese locale, so it's not some strawman, although this particular
	example is, admittedly, pretty perverse.</p>
	<p>
		The problem illustrated here is that there are sequences of
		bytes that can mean a number of things, depending on
		where you start. There are two problems with that. One,
		if there's the slightest bit of corruption (a lost or garbled byte),
		you can screw up a long section because there's no good way
		to resynchronize. Related to that is the problem of "backing up"
		one or two characters (or moving ahead) if you're parsing text.
		You just can't figure out where you are.
	</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Encodings Are Better Than Others</h1>
	<p>You should use UTF-8</p>
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<img src="bytecolors.png" alt="UTF-8 bytes have colors"/>
	</div>
<div class="handout">
	In UTF-8, on the other hand, certain bit patterns are reserved for
	certain functions, which I've represented as colors in this
	slide. This makes UTF-8 robust in the face of corruption--you only
	lose a single character per byte lost--and easy to resynchronize
	in parsing--you only ever need to move a maximum of three bytes
	in the stream to find a "start byte".
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Some Encodings Are Better Than Others</h1>
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<img src="utfs.png" alt="The UTF family"/>
	</div>
<div class="handout">
	There are other Unicode encodings, or "transformation formats",
	defined, but we don't have time to explain why or how to choose
	one. It's good enough to know that for most of what you want to
	do with text, UTF-8 is excellent. And, remember, I said so.
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>You Have To Be Explicit</h1>
	<p>The "assumed" encodings for the popular programming languages 
	on the popular platforms are all Eurocentric, and are
	mutually incompatible.</p>
<div class="handout">
	If you rely on the default encodings for various pieces of software,
	you will lose data! I want you to keep data, and understand it.
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>There's No Reason Not To Use Unicode</h1>
<p>
	Every web browser can correctly interpret and represent
	all Unicode encodings (the UTF family). 
</p>
<div class="handout">
	All of your clients, your readers, the capitalists who are funding
	your startups... they all have software that use Unicode.
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>There's No Reason Not To Use Unicode</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Java, Python, and Perl all support Unicode very well.</li>
	<li class="incremental" style="font-size:50%">(Ruby, not so well.)</li>
	<li class="incremental">But you have to know what you're doing.</li>
	<li class="incremental">But it's easy to learn.</li>
</ul>
